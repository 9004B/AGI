Creating AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) for real, no joke, cuz fuck
Elon Musk.

Tell me on [Issues](https://github.com/9004B/AGI/issues) or send a pull
request or contact me wherever you found me. It must be Javascript/Node.js
and don't bother sending in anything if it uses any complicated math/stat.

# Mind 101

Despite popular belief, there's nothing to mind than being able to report
similar to humans. Don't fall for the very very deeeeep mind or other
machine learning bs, they are just braindead correlation machine, human
brains are particularly created, it's not generated from randomly
correlated training data. All we gotta do is follow structure of the brain
and imitate details of neuronal functions, not the simplified bs that's
popular now.

+ Know something about these (random things, will fix/update later):
    + Concious processing uses up more energy than unconscious ones
    + "mice implanted with human glial cells became smarter, or at least
      faster learners, than other mice" 
    + lateral inhabitation -- strongly activeated neuron inhibiting peers 
    +  Neuron the same, synaptogenesis makes brain weight to tripple by age
       2, happens in spurts. Also pruning of unnecessary pathway and
       connection. (eg: around dead cell).
